Entity Framework Fluent API is used to configure domain classes to override conventions. 
EF Fluent API is based on a Fluent API design pattern (a.k.a Fluent Interface) 
where the result is formulated by method chaining.

In Entity Framework Core, the ModelBuilder class acts as a Fluent API. 
By using it, we can configure many different things, as it provides more configuration
 options than data annotation attributes.
